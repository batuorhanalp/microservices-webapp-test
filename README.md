# Production Web App Project

This project demonstrates building a production-ready web application with modern cloud-native technologies.

## Learning Path

### Phase 1: System Design ✅
- [x] Architecture documentation
- [x] Technology stack selection
- [x] Cloud provider resource mapping

### Phase 2: Azure Infrastructure ✅
- [x] Terraform infrastructure as code
- [x] Azure resource configurations (AKS, PostgreSQL, Redis, Storage, CDN, Event Hub)
- [x] Environment setup scripts and deployment automation
- [x] Multi-environment support (dev/staging/prod)
- [x] Security and monitoring setup

### Phase 3: Multi-Cloud Compatibility ✅
- [x] AWS EKS infrastructure module
- [x] GCP GKE infrastructure module  
- [x] Terraform for unified provisioning

### Phase 4: Kubernetes Configuration
- [ ] Deployment manifests
- [ ] Service definitions
- [ ] ConfigMaps and Secrets
- [ ] Ingress controllers

### Phase 5: Application Development
- [ ] Frontend React app
- [ ] Backend API services
- [ ] WebSocket implementation
- [ ] Database models and migrations

### Phase 6: Local Development
- [ ] Docker Compose setup
- [ ] Local development environment
- [ ] Testing and debugging

### Phase 7: Cloud Deployments
- [ ] Azure deployment
- [ ] AWS deployment
- [ ] GCP deployment

## Quick Start

Each phase includes detailed instructions in its respective directory. Start with the system design document in `docs/` and follow the learning path above.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- kubectl (Kubernetes CLI)
- Cloud CLI tools (az, aws, gcloud)
- Terraform (optional, for multi-cloud)

## Getting Started

1. Review the system design: `docs/system-design.md`
2. Set up your development environment
3. Follow the phase-by-phase implementation guide
