## How to Deploy Right Now

1. **Install Prerequisites**:
   ```bash
   # Install Azure CLI
   brew install azure-cli
   
   # Install Terraform
   brew install terraform
   
   # Login to Azure
   az login
   ```

2. **Deploy Infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   cd webapp-production
   ./scripts/deploy-azure.sh deploy dev
   ```

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   kubectl get namespaces
   ```

## What You'll See After Deployment

### Azure Resources
- **Resource Group**: `webapp-prod-dev-rg`
- **AKS Cluster**: `webapp-prod-dev-aks` (2 nodes)
- **PostgreSQL**: `webapp-prod-dev-postgres` (private network)
- **Redis Cache**: `webapp-prod-dev-redis` (250MB)
- **Storage Account**: `webappproddevstorage`
- **Container Registry**: `webappproddevacr`
- **CDN**: `webapp-prod-dev-cdn`

### Estimated Monthly Cost
- Development environment: ~$110-145/month
- Includes AKS, PostgreSQL, Redis, storage, monitoring

### Connection Information
All connection strings and credentials will be available via:
```bash
terraform output database_connection_info
terraform output redis_connection_info
terraform output kubernetes_cluster_info
```

## Learning Outcomes

By completing Phase 2, you've learned:

1. **Infrastructure as Code** best practices with Terraform
2. **Azure cloud services** architecture and integration
3. **Kubernetes** cluster setup and networking
4. **Security** patterns for production environments
5. **Cost optimization** strategies
6. **Monitoring and observability** setup
7. **Multi-environment** deployment patterns

## Next Phase Options

You have several paths forward:

### Option A: Multi-Cloud (Recommended for Learning)
Continue to **Phase 3** and add AWS/GCP support to understand different cloud providers.

### Option B: Kubernetes Applications (Faster to Production)
Jump to **Phase 4** and start deploying Kubernetes resources and applications.

### Option C: Application Development (Most Practical)
Skip to **Phase 5** and start building the actual web application.

## Phase 3 Preview: Multi-Cloud Support

Next, we'll add:
- **AWS EKS module** with RDS and ElastiCache
- **GCP GKE module** with Cloud SQL and Memorystore
- **Unified Terraform** that works across all clouds
- **Cross-cloud comparison** and migration strategies

## Phase 4 Preview: Kubernetes Resources

We'll create:
- **Deployment manifests** for web app components
- **Service definitions** with load balancing
- **ConfigMaps and Secrets** for configuration
- **Ingress controllers** for traffic routing
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling**

## Phase 5 Preview: Application Development

We'll build:
- **React frontend** with modern UI
- **Node.js backend** with Express
- **WebSocket support** for real-time features
- **Database models** and migrations
- **API documentation**

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check prerequisites**: Ensure Azure CLI and Terraform are installed
2. **Verify authentication**: Run `az account show`
3. **Review logs**: Check Terraform output for specific errors
4. **Resource conflicts**: Change `app_name` in tfvars if names are taken
5. **Permissions**: Ensure your Azure account has Contributor access
